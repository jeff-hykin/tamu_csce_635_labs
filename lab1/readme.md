# What is this?

This is code for the survivor buddy lab assignment.

## How do I submit?

- Once the code is setup, you'll have a `run/check` command. Run it and you'll get a checklist to make sure you've done everything.

# What generally needs to be done?

- Create a github repo for your assignment (from the readme before this one)
- Setup a linux system
    - Get Linux (a specific-ish version)
    - Get ROS + Rviz running
- Week 1 Tasks: Learning the ropes
    - Demo using the tools/api's to me in person (or on video)
- Week 2 Tasks: Following a schema
    - Demo some virtual actions to me
- Week 3 Tasks: Multi behavior
    - Demo actually making some coehsive behavior on physical bot
- Week 4 Tasks: Face detection
    - Demo a decently working system on a physical bot

## How do I do the things?

- First, note: If the instructions say something like "loud" or "a long time", you get to pick what is considered loud/a long time.
    - The only caveat is for the "well technically" kinda people like myself; if you pick something like 1 nano second and say "well I think thats a long time" we will choose 5 of your peers at random, and get them to judge whether or not its a ridiculous choice.
- On github, above this readme there should be an "instructions" folder. Open it to see instructions for each week.

# Due when?

Note: lots of these are in person. E.g. "Fri" means "Fri when I leave EABC" not "Fri at 11:59pm"

- week 1: Fri Feb 9
- week 2: Fri Feb 16
- (skip a week for Test)
- week 3: Fri March 1st
