# What is this?

This is a repo/template for the lab assignments.

# Due when?

Note: lots of these are in person. E.g. "Fri" means "Fri when I leave EABC" not "Fri at 11:59pm"

- lab 1:
    - week 1: Fri Feb 9
    - week 2: Fri Feb 16
    - (skip a week for Test)
    - week 3: Fri March 1st
    - week 4: Fri March 8st

- lab 2:
    - (pending)

# What needs to be done?

### 1. Use this github repo as a template

- If already used the survivor_buddy template
    - Still follow the instructions here (use this template). Sorry for making you create two repos, but all the setup steps are the same. So if you already followed the setup, then creating the new repo and cloning it is basically all you need to do.
- Click the green "Use Template" button in the top-right-ish of the github page (probably the page you're on)
- MAKE YOURS PRIVATE 
    - [tutorial](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57836411/how-can-i-switch-a-public-repo-to-private-and-vice-versa-on-github)
    - You can get Github Pro for free using your university email, and Github Pro lets you make private repos for free.

- Message me your repo URL on CampusWire and tell me your email. (Otherwise idk who is who with github usernames)

#### 2. Copy the url of your repo for a later step (ex: my url is https://github.com/jeff-hykin/tamu_csce_635_labs.git)
#### 3. Above this readme is a folder for each lab. Click the folder and see the `readme.md` inside for instructions.
