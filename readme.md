# What is this?

This is a repo/template for the lab assignments.


# What needs to be done?

### 1. Make your own github repo

- Click the green "Use Template" button in the top-right-ish of the github page (probably the page you're on)
- MAKE IT PRIVATE 
    - [tutorial](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57836411/how-can-i-switch-a-public-repo-to-private-and-vice-versa-on-github)
    - You can get Github Pro for free using your university email, and Github Pro lets you make private repos for free.

- Message me your repo URL on CampusWire and tell me your email. (Otherwise idk who is who with github usernames)

#### 2. Copy the url of your repo for a later step (ex: my url is https://github.com/jeff-hykin/tamu_csce_635_labs.git)
#### 3. Above this readme is a folder for each lab. Click the folder and see the `readme.md` inside for instructions.
